===

Introduction:
---
In this assignment, I implement and compare different search strategies for solving the n-Puzzle, which is a generalization of the 8 and 15 puzzle to squares of arbitrary size. 

Files:
---
Search.py - Python code that implements BFS, DFS, Greedy First Search and A* Search.

Example:
---
A test case:

```Python
    test_state = ((7, 2, 4),
                  (5, 0, 6), 
                  (8, 3, 1)) 
```
