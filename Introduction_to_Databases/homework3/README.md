# README

By executing all .sql files, a schema `RegistrationSystem` will be created. Please execute the .sql files in the following sequence (detailed explanation please check the comments added to the code):

1.Tables.sql 
---
Create 8 tables `department`, `person`, `student`, `faculty`, `courses`, `sections`, `course_prereqs` and `course_participant` in the schema.

2.Views.sql
---
Create four views according the requirements of homework3.

3.Functions.sql
---
Create 4 functions `generate_uni`, `get_semester`, `check_student`, `check_faculty` which are called in triggers and procedures. 

4.Triggers.sql
---
Create 8 triggers for inserting data into student, faculty, person, course_participant table, updating data on student, faculty table, and deleting data from student, faculty table.

5.Procedures.sql
---
Create 6 stored_procedures for inserting, updating and deleting data in student and faculty table.

6.TestData.sql

After executing all files, the schema should be created properly.
