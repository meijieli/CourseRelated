Introduction
---
Build a student registration system database model. Some requirements are:


**Requirement #1**

>>Implement a 3 table solution for inheritance for Person, Student and Faculty.
>>Each class is concrete, which means that there will be instances of Person that are not a Faculty or Student.
>>There are no entities/objects that are both a Faculty and Student.

**Requirement #2**

>>For each of Student and Faculty,
>>Implement a view that supports query of all attributes, including those in the corresponding Person tuple.
>>Implement a procedure for create, update and delete of an entity by UNI. The procedures should affect both the derived >>entity, e.g. student, and the base entity (Person).

**Requirement #3**
>>Enforce the constrains below using triggers.
>>>>A student may ONLY enroll in a section if the student has completed the course prereqs.
>>>>Sections have enrollment limits. A student enrollment should fail if the course is at then enrollment limit.
>>>>A faculty member may only teach 3 sections a semester.

**Requirement #4**
>>Create the following views:
>>>>A view that contains a tuple for each student of the form (UNI, completed course, year and semester completed). 
>>>>A view that contains a tuple for each faculty member of the form (uni, course_id, semester, year) representing each course a faculty member is teaching or has taught.

**Please execute the .sql files in the following sequence (detailed explanation please check the comments added to the code):**

1.Tables.sql 
---
Create 8 tables `department`, `person`, `student`, `faculty`, `courses`, `sections`, `course_prereqs` and `course_participant` in the schema.

2.Functions.sql
---
Create 4 functions `generate_uni`, `get_semester`, `check_student`, `check_faculty` which are called in triggers and procedures. 

3.Triggers.sql
---
Create 8 triggers for inserting data into `faculty`, `person`, `course_participant` table, updating data on `student`, `faculty` table, and deleting data from `student`, `faculty` table.

4.Procedures.sql
---
Create 6 stored_procedures for inserting, updating and deleting data in `student` and `faculty` table.

5.TestData.sql
---
Populate the schema with test data in all tables. Most test data are generated by two Java programs PersonGenerator. java and Course_Participant_Generator.java. (To insert all data, please comment out the insert trigger of course_participant table)

6.Views.sql
---
Create four views according the requirements of homework3.

After executing all files above, the schema should be created properly. 

7.SampleQueries.sql
---
Provide some simple sample queries to show the validity of triggers, procedures, etc and how to do queries in this database.
